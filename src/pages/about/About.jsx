          Hi, I’m Omkar Narayan Bhal, a passionate full-stack developer with a knack for turning ideas into functional, user-friendly web applications. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Centurion University of Technology and Management in Bhubaneswar, I’ve developed a strong foundation in Java, JavaScript, React.js, and cloud technologies like AWS, all while maintaining a CGPA of 8.53. Along the way, I’ve also dived deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), REST APIs, and AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance my technical expertise.

Throughout my journey, I’ve had the chance to work on various exciting projects. One of the highlights is OmieAi, an NLP-powered AI chatbot built using the Gemini API with a Node.js and Express.js backend, paired with a React.js frontend. This project enhanced real-time interaction and user engagement, and building the RESTful API to handle data flow between the AI and frontend was a rewarding challenge.

Another standout project is E-Learn, an online learning platform I built using the MERN stack. It features everything from secure JWT and OTP authentication to a seamless Razorpay payment integration, allowing users to purchase and access courses with ease. The platform includes progress tracking, quizzes, and assignments for a comprehensive learning experience, and of course, I integrated AI assistance for doubt clarification.

I’ve also had the chance to intern at Teachnook, where I worked as a Web Developer, helping to build a frontend architecture that’s both functional and user-friendly for a project aimed at over 12,000 users. It was an incredible experience collaborating with the backend team to bring the project to life. Before that, I was a Full-Stack Developer Intern at SkillVertex, where I worked on both small-scale and large-scale web applications using the MERN stack, honing my skills and contributing to projects that made a real difference.

I’m always eager to learn more and improve my skills. Cloud computing, in particular, is an area I’m really passionate about, and I’m constantly exploring new technologies in that space. I’ve earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, and I’m determined to dive deeper into cloud architecture and services.

At the core of everything I do, I aim to build solutions that are not only functional but also efficient and user-centric. Whether it’s collaborating with teams, problem-solving, or managing projects using Agile methodologies, I’m always up for the challenge. I love what I do, and I’m excited to continue growing as a developer, exploring new technologies, and contributing to impactful projects.
